#A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value
# eg : x = 5 # Here, x is a variable and 5 is its value


# 1.2.1 Type Casting a Variable
# The process of converting the value of one data type into another. 
 
# Basic Casting Functions
# int() ->   Converts compatible values to an integer.
# float() -> Transforms values into floating-point numbers.
# str() ->   Converts any data type into a string.

# Eg:
# x = 5
# print(float(x))



#1.2.2 Getting Type of Variable
# If you wanna know what is the type of variable , you can use type() function.

# eg:
n = 42
f = 3.14
s = "Hello, World!"
li = [1, 2, 3]
d = {'key': 'value'}
bool = True

# Get and print the type of each variable
print(type(n))   
print(type(f)) 
print(type(s))   
print(type(li))     
print(type(d))     
print(type(bool))
